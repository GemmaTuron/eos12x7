Title: Spacial Score topological indicator of molecular complexity
Description: This tool computes the Spatial Score (SPS) and its size-normalized variant
  (nSPS), two empirical descriptors of molecular spatial complexity that extend commonly
  used measures such as the fraction of sp3-hybridized carbons (Fsp3) and stereogenic
  carbons (FCstereo) by capturing additional aspects of molecular topology and three-dimensionality
  on a highly granular scale. The normalized score enables comparison across molecules
  of different sizes and differentiates natural products from synthetic compounds,
  while analyses of large bioactivity datasets such as ChEMBL show general trends
  of increasing potency and selectivity with higher nSPS values.
